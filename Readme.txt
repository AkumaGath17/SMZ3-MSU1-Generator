1) Place each PCM Sets in the corresponding directories (by default: "alttp_msu" and "supermetroid_msu"), these must be in the same directory as "Generate-PCM.bat" File.

2) Double click on "Generate-PCM.bat" File.

3) Rename a ROM File to "sm_alttp_randomizer_msu1.sfc" and place it in "smz3_msu" directory folder.

4) Wait for the program to finish. You may see an error message but that should be optional .pcm missing files.

Folders, output .pcm and rom names can be modified at the beginning of the .bat file code.
