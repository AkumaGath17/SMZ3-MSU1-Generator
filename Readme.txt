1) Place each PCM Sets in the corresponding directories (by default: "alttp_msu" and "supermetroid_msu"), these must be in the same directory as "Generate-PCM.bat" File.

2) Double click on "Generate-PCM.bat" File.

3) Rename a ROM File to "sm_alttp_randomizer_msu1.sfc" and place it in "smz3_msu" directory folder.

4) Make sure that "sm_alttp_randomizer_msu1.msu" exist in the "smz3_msu" directory folder (if missing, create an empty file with that name and extension).
